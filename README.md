# SimpleRPG Godot Inventory

I have another repository with a simple RPG game I made in Godot, so I went ahead and tried to implement an inventory system that works, but it's not dynamic so it's not perfect.
- In simple terms, the game has:
  - Basic enemies 
  - Basic movement and combat
  - Basic npc interaction
  - Poor quest system
  - Inventory system (draggable, hotbar, but not dynamic slot allocation)
